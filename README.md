# Git-Github
hello

#how I fix the bug.
Actually, one error i had was that I was denied access when I was pushing to Github, as shown below:

remote: Permission to VeeSprout/Git-Github.git denied to Otsebolu.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/VeeSprout/Git-Github.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

What I did was to first fork before clonong the repo
